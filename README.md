## üöÄ Overview

SubHunterX is a powerful bug bounty automation framework designed to silently map attack surfaces and uncover critical vulnerabilities. By combining military-grade reconnaissance techniques with intelligent automation, SubHunterX gives security professionals the edge in identifying security weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Stealth Subdomain Enumeration**: Uncover hidden assets with minimal footprint
- **Parallel Processing Engine**: Lightning-fast execution for time-sensitive operations
- **Real-time Target Validation**: Immediate verification of discovered assets
- **Advanced Fingerprinting**: Identify technologies and potential attack vectors
- **API Infiltration**: Automatically detect and analyze API endpoints
- **Aggressive Content Discovery**: Thorough directory and file enumeration
- **Vulnerability Pattern Recognition**: Pre-configured detection for common security issues
- **Network Topology Mapping**: Complete DNS resolution and IP correlation
- **Operational Security Logging**: Detailed activity tracking with OPSEC considerations
